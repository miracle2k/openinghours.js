/**
 * Can format a string such as "Closed. Opens Monday, 8:00".
 *
 * At first, I tried to have a very smart algorithm which iterates over the list of rules once and finds all
 * the information needed. But I couldn't do it. Consider the following case:
 *
 *    It is 22th of December, a Sunday.
 *    Rule 1: Tuesday, open from 08:00 to 15:00.
 *    Rule 2: 24th of December, a Tuesday, closed.
 *
 * Here, we have to recognize that the second rule modifies the effect of the first. The answer to the question,
 * "when do we open?", is "according to rule 1 and rule 2 combined, on the tuesday one week later".
 *
 * Instead of being smart, we take the easier route of having a logic for "find the rule which applies to a given
 * day", and then "iterate day for day until we find one where the rules tell us it is open".
 *
 * How about this for a test:
 *
 *    Rule 1: Tuesday, open from 08:00 to 15:00.
 *    Rule 2: 20th October, a Tuesday, open from 18:00 to 20:00.
 *
 * What does it mean? In all likelihood, that on the 20h of October, we only open at 6, and rule 1 is fully replaced.
 *
 * How about this:
 *
 *     Rule 1: Any day, 08:00 to 18:00
 *     Rule 2: Through January, on Tuesday, 10:00 to 18:00
 *
 * What does this mean? During January, are we ONLY open on Tuesday, or do merely modify the regular dates?
 * I think the latter; otherwise, multiple "through January" rules would need to be taken together.
 *
 * How about this:
 *
 *     Rule 1: Any day, 08:00 to 18:00
 *     Rule 2: Through January, on Tuesday, 10:00 to 18:00
 *     Rule 3: January the 5th, closed.
 *
 * Presumably, on January the 5th, Rule 3 overrides Rule 2. It seems more specific.
 *
 * How about this;
 *
 *    Rule 1: Any day, 08:00 to 12:00
 *    Rule 2: Any day, 14:00 to 18:00
 *
 * What if the rules are reversed? Are we smart enough to look at both of them / the right one, to find the
 * "next" opening time?
